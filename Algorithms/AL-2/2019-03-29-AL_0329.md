## 문제풀이

```sql
SELECT Start_Date, MIN(End_Date)
FROM
    (SELECT Start_Date FROM Projects WHERE Start_Date NOT IN (SELECT End_Date FROM Projects)) as s,
    (SELECT End_Date FROM Projects WHERE End_Date NOT IN (SELECT Start_Date FROM Projects)) as e
WHERE Start_Date < End_Date
GROUP BY Start_Date
ORDER BY DATEDIFF(MIN(End_Date), Start_Date), Start_Date;
```

- Every derived table must have its own alias : alias 붙여주면 해결
- DATEDIFF(date1, date2)
    - 날짜의 차이를 계산하기 위해 사용
    - 즉, date1의 값에서 date2의 값을 뺀 날짜의 값을 반환하여 결과를 보여준다.
