## 문제풀이

```sql
SELECT w.id, wp.age, w.coins_needed, w.power
FROM Wands AS w
    LEFT JOIN Wands_Property AS wp ON w.code = wp.code
WHERE w.coins_needed = (SELECT MIN(Wands.coins_needed)
                        FROM Wands LEFT JOIN Wands_Property ON Wands.code = Wands_Property.code
                        WHERE Wands_Property.is_evil = 0
                            AND Wands.power = w.power
                            AND Wands_Property.age = wp.age)
ORDER BY w.power DESC, wp.age DESC
;
```
- 서브 쿼리로 알아내는것을 잘 생각 못했음 -> 파워, age 같으나 그중에 싼거를 찾는 문제였음
