phone_book = dict()

# number of input info
n = int(input())
for _ in range(n):
    info = str(input()).split(" ")

    name = info[0]
    phone = int(info[1])
    phone_book[name] = phone

for j in range(n):
    search_name = str(input())

    if search_name in phone_book:
        print(search_name+"="+str(phone_book[search_name]))

    else:
