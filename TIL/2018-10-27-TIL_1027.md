## Database Systems Concepts & Design
### Lesson9.

----

1. SQL : Create Table Statements

```sql
CREATE TABLE `User`(
  Email varchar(50) NOT NULL,
  FirstName varchar(50) NOT NULL,
  LastName varchar(50) NOT NULL,
  Password varchar(50) NOT NULL,
  PRIMARY KEY(Email);
)

CREATE TABLE RegularUser(
  Email varchar(50) NOT NULL,
  Sex char(1) NULL,
  Birthdate datetime NULL,
  CurrentCity varchar(50) NULL,
  Hometown varchar(50) NULL,
  PRIMARY KEY(Email),
  FOREIGN KEY(Email)
      REFERENCES `User`(Email);
)
```

2. M2M 관계 테이블

```sql
CREATE TABLE Attend(
  Email varchar(50) NOT NULL,
  SchoolName varchar(50) NOT NULL,
  YearGraduated int NULL,
  UNIQUE (Email, SchoolName, YearGraduated),
  FOREIGN KEY(Email) REFERENCES RegularUser(Email))
  FOREIGN KEY(SchoolName) REFERENCES School(SchoolName));
```

3. Design-on to Abstract Code
- ER 다이어그램을 이제 sql코드로 변경

4. SQL-View

```sql
SELECT FirstName,LastName,Birthdate,Sex,CurrentCity,Hometown
FROM User INNER JOIN RegularUser ON User.Email = RegularUser.Email
WHERE Email=$Email;

SELECT School.SchoolName, School.Type, Attend.YearGraduated
FROM Attend INNER JOIN School ON Attend.SchoolName=School.Schoo
WHERE Email = $Email
ORDER BY Attend.YearGraduated DESC;


UPDATE RegularUser
SET Sex=$Sex, Birthday=$Birthday, CurrentCity=$CurrentCity, Hometown=$Hometown
WHERE Email=$Email

for each $Interest
INSERT INTO Interest(Email, Interest) VALUES($Email, $Interest);
end for

// click Delete the School
DELETE FROM Attend
WHERE Email=$Email And SchoolName=$SchoolName
  AND YearGraduated=$YearGraduated

//add the school
for each $SchoolName, $YearGraduated
INSERT INTO Attend(Email ,SchoolName, YearGraduated)
  VALUES ($Email, $SchoolName, $YearGraduated)
end for

// 3 WAY JOIN 
//show pending requests to you
SELECT R.Email, FirstName, LastName, Hometown, Relationship
FROM Friendship AS F INNER JOIN RegularUser AS R ON F.Email = R.Email INNER JOIN User AS U ON U.Email=R.Email
WHERE F.FriendEmail=$Email AND DateConnected IS NULL
```
