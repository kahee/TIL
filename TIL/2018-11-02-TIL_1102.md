## Database Systems Concepts & Design
### Lesson11. SQL(2)

-----

14. String Matching

```sql
SELECT Email, Sex, CurrentCity
FROM RegularUser
WHERE CurrentCity LIKE 'San%';

SELECT Email, Sex, Hometown
FROM RegularUser
WHERE HomeTown LIKE 'A_ _ _ _ _';

```
- % 모든 문자열을 표현하며, 빈 문자열도 포함한다.
- _ 문자 한개를 의미

15. Sorting

```sql
SELECT Email, Sex, CurrentCity
FROM RegularUser
WHERE Sex = 'M'
ORDER BY CurrentCity ASC;
```
- ASC : 오름차순
- DESC : 내림차순

16. Set Operation - union

```sql
SELECT CurrentCity
FROM RegularUser
UNION
SELECT HomeTown
FROM RegularUser

SELECT CurrentCity
FROM RegularUser
UNION ALL
SELECT HomeTown
FROM RegularUser
```

- UNION : 공통된 사항은 삭제
- UNION ALL : 공통적인 것도 포함

17. Intersection

```sql
SELECT CurrentCity
FROM RegularUser
INTERSECT
SELECT HomeTown
FROM RegularUser;
```

- INTERSECT (ALL) : 각 테이블에서 같은 항복만 추출

18. Except

```sql

SELECT CurrentCity
FROM RegularUser
EXCEPT
SELECT HomeTown
FROM RegularUser;
```

- EXCEPT (ALL) : 차집합 개념

19. Built in Function

```sql
SELECT count(*)
FROM RegularUser

SELECT Email, max(BirthYear)
FROM RegularUser
WHERE SEX = 'F';
````

- count, sum , avg, min, max


20. Group By

```sql
SELECT Email, count(*) AS NumInt, avg(sinceAge)AvgAge
FROM UserInterest
GROUP BY Email
ORDER BY NumInt ASC;
```

- 집계함수와 함께 사용되는 상수는 GROUP BY 절에 추가하지 않아도 된다.
- GROUP BY로 지정된 필드로 데이터들을 나눔

21. Having - condition on the group

```sql
SELECT Email, count(*) as Numlnt, avg(sinceAge)AvgAge
FROM UserInterests
GROUP BY email
HAVING NumInt > 1
ORDER BY NumInt ASC;
```

22. Nested Queries - IN/NOT IN

```sql
SELECT Email, Interest
FROM UserInterest
WHERE Email IN (
  SELECT Email
  FROM RegularUser
  WHERE HomeTown = 'Atlanta'
);

SELECT Email, Interest
FROM UserInterest I, RegularUser U
WHERE I.EMAIL = U.EMAIL AND HomeTown ='Atlanta';
```

23. = !=. <=, >=. < , some/ALL

```sql
SELECT CurrentCity
FROM RegularUser R, YearSalary Y
WHERE R.BirthYear = Y.birthYear AND Salary > ALL(
  SELECT Salary
  FROM RegularUser U, YearSalary
  WHERE R.BirthYear = Y.birthYear AND Hometown = 'Austin'
);
```

24. Correlated

```sql
SELECT R.Email, BirthYear
FROM RegularUser R
WHERE NOT EXITS(
  SELECT*
  FROM UserInterests U
  WHERE U.Email = R.Email
)
